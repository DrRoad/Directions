Directions
==========

This mini project fetches driving directions using the Google Maps Directions API. It also contains custom JSON deserialization code (GSON).

Given a pair of addresses: origin & destination, you can get a nicely formatted list of driving directions.

Example
=======

Let the addresses be as follows:

Origin: 340 University Ave, Palo Alto, CA
Destination: 601 Nelson Rd, Stanford, CA
